# RandomNoticeDiscordBot
A Discord bot who sends random notifications on call

This is a repository to practice some programming, you could clone it, use it and modify it but dont expect code quality, best practices or even the software to work
Also, since i'm working for myself, there will probably be a lot of things in spanish in between the code

## Instaling and running the bot

To run this bot you'll need to have node.js installed, and a discord app configured as it says [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html) the are still no permissions required for this bot, but this could change in the future.

You will then need to copy and rename *appsettings-example.json* to *appsettings.json* replacing its variables and deletting the comments

Then install the dependencies:

    npm install

And run the bot:
    
    node index.js

## Understandig the code

I've tried to imitate what has been done in the [Discord.js's Guide](https://discordjs.guide/) please refer to this guide beforehand
